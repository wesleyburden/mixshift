# mixshift
This is my personal starter point for a new [mixture](http://mixture.io) project.  It's certainly a work in progress and is designed to integrate nicely with the [shift](https://github.com/codeharbour/shift) WordPress starter theme.

## Additional useful packages
Use bower to install packages into assets/lib (bower config file included to put installed packages in this directory).

bower install jquery.oddCanvasMenu (https://github.com/wesleyburden/offCanvasMenu)
bower install owlcarousel (https://github.com/OwlFonk/OwlCarousel)
